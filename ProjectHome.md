Adaptive Hypermedia is a disputed research field where hypermedia is made adaptive according to a user model. In contrast to traditional e-learning/electronic learning, e-business, and e-government systems, whereby all users are offered or even directed a standard series of hyperlinks, adaptive hypermedia (AH) tailors what the user sees to a model of the user's goals, preferences and knowledge. Adaptive hypermedia is the answer to the "lost in hyperspace" problem, where the user normally has too many links to choose from, and little knowledge about how to proceed and select the most appropriate ones to him/her. Adaptive hypermedia thus offers a selection of links or content most appropriate to the current user. -- from wikipedia
